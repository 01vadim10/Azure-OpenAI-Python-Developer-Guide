## LangChain

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is an open source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs).

A chain in LangChain is an end-to-end wrapper around multiple individual components executed in a defined order. Chains allow you to go beyond just a single API call to a language model and instead chain together multiple calls in a logical sequence. Chains can perform various natural language processing tasks, such as content generation, summarization, question answering, and more. There are three types of chains in LangChain: LLMChain, Sequential Chain, and Router Chain. Each type has its own structure, functionality, and use cases.

It provides a standard interface for chains, the ability to integrate with external tools and systems, and end-to-end chains for common applications. LangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents capable of robotic process automation.
