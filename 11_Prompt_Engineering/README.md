## LangChain

[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is an open source framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs).

LangChain provides a syntax for chains, the ability to integrate with external tools and systems, and end-to-end agents for common applications. LangChain can facilitate most use cases for LLMs and natural language processing (NLP), like chatbots, intelligent search, question-answering, summarization services or even virtual agents.
