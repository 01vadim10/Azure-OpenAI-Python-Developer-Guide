# Overview of Azure Cosmos DB (high-level with links to docs for more information)

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that enables you to query and store data using NoSQL models using one of five APIs: SQL (document database), Cassandra (column-family), MongoDB (document database), Azure Table, and Gremlin (graph database). It provides turnkey global distribution, elastic scaling of throughput and storage worldwide, single-digit millisecond latencies at the 99th percentile, and guaranteed high availability with multi-homing capabilities. Azure Cosmos DB provides comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs) for throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees, something not found in any other database service.
