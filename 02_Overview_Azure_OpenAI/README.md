Here are ways that Azure OpenAI can help developers:

- **Simplified integration** - Simple and easy-to-use APIs for tasks such as text generation, summarization, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more.
- **Pre-trained models** - AI models that are already fine-tuned on vast amounts of data making it easier for developers to leverage the power of AI without having to train their own models from scratch.
- **Customization** - Developers can also fine-tune the included pre-trained models with their own data with minimal coding, providing an opportunity to create more personalized and specialized AI applications.
- **Documentation and resources** - Azure OpenAI provides comprehensive documentation and resources to help developers get started quickly.
- **Scalability and reliability** - Hosted on Microsoft Azure, the OpenAI service provides robust scalability and reliability that developers can leverage to deploy their applications.
- **Responsible AI** - Azure OpenAI promotes responsible AI by adhering to ethical principles, providing explainability tools, governance features, diversity and inclusion support, and collaboration opportunities. These measures help ensure that AI models are unbiased, explainable, trustworthy, and used in a responsible and compliance manner.
- **Community support** - With an active developer community developers can seek help via forums and other community support channels.

## Data Privacy and Security

Azure OpenAI stores and processes data to provide the service and to monitor for uses that violate the applicable product terms. Azure OpenAI is fully controlled by Microsoft. Microsoft hosts the OpenAI models in Microsoft Azure for your usage of Azure OpenAI, and does not interact with any services operated by OpenAI.

Here are a few important things to know in regards to the security and privacy of your prompts (inputs) and completions (outputs), your embeddings, and your training data when using Azure OpenAI:

- are NOT available to other customers.
- are NOT available to OpenAI.
- are NOT used to improve OpenAI models.
- are NOT used to improve any Microsoft or 3rd party products or services.
- are NOT used for automatically improving Azure OpenAI models for your use in your resource (The models are stateless, unless you explicitly fine-tune models with your training data).
- Your fine-tuned Azure OpenAI models are available exclusively for your use.
